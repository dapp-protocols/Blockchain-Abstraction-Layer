This project has moved to [Follow My Vote GitLab](https://gitlab.followmy.vote/pollaris/BAL).

The DApp Protocols team is deprecating our GitHub repositories. Follow My Vote is generously providing us with hosting on their repository infrastructure until the DApp Protocols project can secure its own.

While GitHub is a widely known and popular hosting provider for open source projects, GitHub itself is a closed source and proprietary application. As such, GitHub has a conflict of interest when it comes to supporting and bettering the open source community.
